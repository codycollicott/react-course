## Passing Props

Next we are going to be passing props to the `<Header />` component. Right now this component should be used to render static information, however we have hard-coded all the values in the Header. We can fix this by passing props to the Header. So we need to change our code a bit. Our visual output again will not change but we should attach a hard-coded prop to our header component 

### Output
1. the title of "My first JSX" should be dynamic and come from the app.js
2. the button of "click me" should be dynamic and come from the app.js
