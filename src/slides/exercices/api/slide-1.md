## API Call

We are going to be making an API call next, this should add dynamic content to what has been a static application. So out application should :

1. make a call to https://codycollicott.github.io/yearbook/Data/students.json with axios
2. update the state with the info returned from the api
3. map over the data in the state 
4. create a custom component that only gets displayed when we have data loaded in our state
5. pass a prop to that component that is from the API data

it should look like this: 

<img src="/react-course/img/lesson/api.png" />

If you have problems you download a completed `src` [here](/react-course/img/downloads/exercices/exercice-7/src.zip)
