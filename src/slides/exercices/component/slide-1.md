## Creating a component

For this exercice we will be moving whatever JSX we made in the previous exercice and create a new component for the `App.js` to use. You should have the same visual output, but one extra file in your `src` folder. This could be called `Header.js` or something similar. Your App.js should import this file then call it within the render.

If you are having problems, you can download an example `src` folder [here](/react-course/img/downloads/exercices/exercice-2/src.zip)
