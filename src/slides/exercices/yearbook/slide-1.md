## Yearbook Assignment

For the yearbook assignment you will be taking the all the HTML and CSS you have done to create a static version of the site and turn it into a react app. In order to complete this exercise your yearbook should: 

1. have components made for the `<Header />` and `<Card />`
2. create an API call via axios to make a `get` request
3. Update the state with the student info
4. map over the results and display the students 
5. Your CSS should be loaded to make the app look like your HTML version

If you would like to see a possible solution you can take a look at:
